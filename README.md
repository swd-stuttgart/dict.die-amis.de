**4. Install pip (package manager)**

Package managers helps us to install Python libraries and tools. We will use it to install Django web framework. There are different package managers but our choice is “pip”.

But before installing pip you may want to check if it is already installed or not. Because some versions of Python has already pip installed in it.
```
pip freeze
```

```
Install Django web framework
```
